# Node JS -

- _Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine._
- _js cannot create backend cause js doesn't have those functionalities which create a backend_
- _Ryan dahl did changes in v8 chrome engine to add backend feature in js_
- _then he thought he need to code in js_
- _cause code of chrome v8 engine is in c++_
- _so then ryan dahl created wrapper on above v8 engine of c++ code_
- _now we can write js code and wrapper layer will receive this and that code with c++ modules will create an server_
- _this whole thing is called node js_
